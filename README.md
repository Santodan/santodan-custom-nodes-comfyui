# Santodan Custom Nodes for ComfyUI

This is a standalone ComfyUI custom node for **randomizing LoRAs** with adjustable strength and support for automatic trigger word injection.

> ‚úÖ Compatible with [comfyui_image_metadata_extension](https://github.com/edelvarden/comfyui_image_metadata_extension) by using the `üíä CR Apply LoRA Stack` from [Suzie1 / Comfyroll_CustomNodes](https://github.com/Suzie1/ComfyUI_Comfyroll_CustomNodes)

# ü™Ñ Wildcard Manager Node

The **Wildcard Manager** is a powerful dynamic prompt and wildcard processor. It allows you to create complex, randomized text prompts using a flexible syntax that supports nesting, weights, multi-selection, and more. It is designed to be compatible with the popular syntax used in the Impact Pack's Wildcard processor, making it easy to adopt existing prompts and wildcards.

Reading the files from the default ComfyUI folder ( `ComfyUi/Wildcards` )

### ‚ú® Key Features & Syntax

-   **Dynamic Prompts:** Randomly select one item from a list.
    -   Example: `{blue|red|green}` will randomly become `blue`, `red`, or `green`.
-   **Wildcards:** Randomly select a line from a `.txt` file in your `ComfyUI/wildcards` directory.
    -   Example: `__person__` will pull a random line from `person.txt`.
-   **Nesting:** Combine syntaxes for complex results.
    -   Example: `{a|{b|__c__}}`
-   **Weighted Choices:** Give certain options a higher chance of being selected.
    -   Example: `{5::red|2::green|blue}` (red is most likely, blue is least).
-   **Multi-Select:** Select multiple items from a list, with a custom separator.
    -   Example: `{1-2$$ and $$cat|dog|bird}` could become `cat`, `dog`, `bird`, `cat and dog`, `cat and bird`, or `dog and bird`.
-   **Quantifiers:** Repeat a wildcard multiple times to create a list for multi-selection.
    -   Example: `{2$$, $$3#__colors__}` expands to select 2 items from `__colors__|__colors__|__colors__`.
-   **Comments:** Lines starting with `#` are ignored, both in the node's text field and within wildcard files.

### üîß Wildcard Manager Inputs

-   `wildcards_list`: A dropdown of your available wildcard files. Selecting one inserts its tag (e.g., `__person__`) into the text.
-   `processing_mode`:
    -   **`line by line`**: Treats each line as a separate prompt for batch processing.
    -   **`entire text as one`**: Processes the entire text block as a single prompt, preserving paragraphs.
	
### üóÇÔ∏è File Management

The node includes buttons for managing your wildcard files directly from the ComfyUI interface, eliminating the need to manually edit text files.

-   **Insert Selected:** Insertes the selected wildcard to the text.
-   **Edit/Create Wildcard:** Opens the content of the wildcard currently selected in the dropdown in an editor, allowing you to make changes and save/create them.
     - You need to have the `[Create New]` selected in the `wildcards_list` dropdown
-   **Delete Selected:** Asks for confirmation and then permanently deletes the wildcard file selected in the dropdown.

# LoRAs Nodes

## üé≤ Randomize LoRAs Node

The **Randomize LoRAs** node lets you experiment by randomly selecting LoRAs from a list and assigning randomized strengths. You can enable exclusive selection (just one LoRA) or allow multiple LoRAs to be mixed.

## üé≤ Random LoRA Folder Selector

The **Random LoRA Folder Selector** node lets you experiment by randomly selecting LoRAs from a doler and assigning randomized strengths. You can enable exclusive selection (just one LoRA) or allow multiple LoRAs to be mixed and how many to be selected by folder.  
Additionally, if the LoRA includes trigger words (via `lora-info`), these are extracted and returned for use in prompts.

## üé≤üö´ Excluded Loras

The **Excluded Loras** node lets you select 5 lroas to be excluded in the **Random LoRA Folder Selecto**, this way you don't need to worry about the select getting an unwanted lora from the folder

## üé≤‚õèÔ∏è Extract And Apply LoRAs

The **Extract And Apply LoRAs** node lets you extract the LoRAs that were saved using the [comfyui_image_metadata_extension](https://github.com/edelvarden/comfyui_image_metadata_extension) node and apply them to a workflow.
This was created so I could try to generate better enhancement workflow but with the same loras and weight as the initial one.
I would recommend use the [SDBatchLoader](https://github.com/receyuki/comfyui-prompt-reader-node) to load multiple images at the same time and connecting the output to the path field in my node

## üé≤üì¶ LoRA Cache Preloader

This is a node to have the information for the loras preloaded into the `db.json`  
You can select the folder that you want to run it.  
This way you don't need to wait for the information to be gathered when running the other two nodes

---

### üîß Node Inputs

I'll describe only the inputs that aren't straight forwards here:
- `refresh_loras`: To force a refresh of LoRAs everytime
- `exclusive_mode`:
  - **On** ‚Äì choose 1 LoRA only
  - **Off** ‚Äì choose a random number from the list
- `stride`: Number of runs before re-randomizing (not currently enforced)
- `lora_count`: the number of LoRAs to be extracted from the list ( if 0 it will be a random value / `exclusive_mode` will overcome this is set to **On** )
- `lora_stack`: (Optional) Input for chaining or merging with existing LoRA stack
- `extra_trigger_words`: (Optional) Additional text to append from previous node
- `force_refresh_cache`: Set to True to clear and regenerate cached LoRA metadata

---

### üì§ Node Outputs

- `LORA_STACK`: A list of `(name, min_strength, max_strength)` tuples
- `Trigger Words`: Comma-separated string of trigger words for selected LoRAs
- `Help Text`: Describes the meaning of each setting for reference

---

### üì§ Cache Behavior

LoRA metadata (like trigger words) is cached to speed up repeat runs.  
Use `force_refresh_cache`: True to clear and reload cache.  
This helps avoid performance issues with large LoRA libraries.
